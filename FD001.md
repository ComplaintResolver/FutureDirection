# FD001

This future direction aims to make the college project into a fully mature project
which anyone can use.

- Every Repository will be ported from ComplaintResolution_legacy one by one
- NoSQL DB are not needed anymore
- Explore Django instead of flask for fuller DB support(Dropping Models)
- `project_settings.py` for fuller customization
- Usage of NativeScript(or React Native) can be considered (dropping cordova).
- Usage of Angular2(Angular material) can be considered.
- Usage of Docker and Swarm(Kubernetes) can be considered for easy packaging of app
